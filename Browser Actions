When an extension adds a little icon next to your address bar, that's a browser action.Your extension
can listen for clicks on that button and then do something.

Put the icon.png from Google's extension tutorial in your extension folder and add this to manifest.json :

"browser_action" : {
"default_icon" : "icon.png"
}

//In order to use the browser action, we need to add message passing.
