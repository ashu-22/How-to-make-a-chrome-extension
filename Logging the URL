jQuery is not necessary, but it makes everything easier.First download a version of jQuery from the JQuery CDN and put it on your extension's
folder. I downloaded the latest minified version, Jquery -2.1.3.min.js. To load it, add it to manifest.json before "content.js".
Your whole manifest.json should look like this.

{
"manifest_version" : 2,
"name": "My Cool Extension" ,
"version": "0.1",
"content_scripts" : [
{
"matches" : [
<"call_urls">
],
"js":["jquery-2.1.3.min.js", "content.js" ]
}
]
}

Now that we have the jQuery, let's use it to log the URL of the first external link on the page in the content.js :


//content.js
var firstHref = $("a[href^ = 'http']").eq(0).attr("href");
console.log("FirstHref");

//Note that we do not need to use jQuery to check if the document has loaded.By default, chrome injects content scripts after the DOM
is complete.

Try it out - you should see the output in your console on every page you visit.
